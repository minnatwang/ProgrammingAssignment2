## Cache the inverse of a matrix for faster inverse retrieval in the future 

## Create functions to set and get both the matrix and its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Returns the inverse either by calculating it or retrieving it from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
